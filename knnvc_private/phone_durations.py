"""
Feature extractor that computes phone durations, based on:

Tomashenko, Natalia, et al. “Exploiting Context-Dependent Duration Features for Voice
Anonymization Attack Systems.” Interspeech 2025.

This feature extractor can be used to replace the spectrogram when training the speaker
recognizer, to assess how much speaker identity is being leaked through phone durations
alone, without any additional speaker information.

! It requires installing private kNN-VC through the spkanon_models repository:
<https://github.com/carlosfranzreb/spkanon_models>

To use it, the spkid model should be trained with config
`spane/config/components/asv/spkid/train_ecapa_phone_durations.yaml`
